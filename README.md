Announcement-Tracker
====================

A tracker with admin panel to track announcements on pages (mainly targeted to parents announcements)

====================
Project is to build a database-driven CRUD app to replace the current static page at http://www.binghamton.edu/dean-of-students/deans-message.html using PHP and MySQL.

Requirements:

* Password-protected admin interface
* Each newsletter consists of a subject (title) and body, like an email
* Newsletters will be stored in a new MySQL database
* Admin users can create, update, delete newsletters
* Admin can change the current version,create drafts, publish.
* Site visitors can search newsletters and view matching search results
* The site will display the most recent newsletter, with links to archived newsletters from previous months


We will be wrapping this in the standard University stylesheet and template.
